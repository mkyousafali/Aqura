-- Migration: Fix clearance certificate task generation to set deadline fields and require_task_finished
-- This fixes the process_clearance_certificate_generation function to properly set:
-- 1. deadline_date (extracted from deadline_datetime)
-- 2. deadline_time (extracted from deadline_datetime) 
-- 3. require_task_finished = true (instead of false)
