# Warning Generation Fix - Complete Task Details in AI-Generated Content

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Issue:** When a warning is issued, the OpenAI-generated content was not including the full details of the task.

## Problem Description

The warning template was displaying a "Performance Summary" section that showed:
- Total Tasks Assigned
- Tasks Completed
- Overdue Tasks
- Completion Rate

However, these fields were empty (showing as 0 or undefined) because:
1. The data wasn't being passed from SendWarningModal to WarningTemplate
2. The AI prompt wasn't instructed to include these statistics in the generated warning text

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/src/lib/components/admin/tasks/SendWarningModal.svelte`

**Changes:**
- Added task performance statistics to the `warningData` object:
  - `totalAssigned`: Total tasks assigned to the employee
  - `totalCompleted`: Number of tasks completed
  - `totalOverdue`: Number of overdue tasks
  - `completionRate`: Percentage completion rate
  - `branchId`: Branch identifier for proper tracking

**Location:** Lines 130-180 (warningData object creation)

```javascript
// Added performance statistics
totalAssigned: assignment.total_assigned || assignment.totalAssigned || 0,
totalCompleted: assignment.total_completed || assignment.totalCompleted || 0,
totalOverdue: assignment.total_overdue || assignment.totalOverdue || 0,
completionRate: assignment.completion_rate || assignment.completionRate || 
                (assignment.total_assigned ? 
                    Math.round((assignment.total_completed / assignment.total_assigned) * 100) : 0),
branchId: assignment.branch_id || null,
```

### 2. `frontend/src/routes/api/generate-warning/+server.js`

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Added Performance Statistics Extraction (Line ~52)
```javascript
// Extract performance statistics
const totalAssigned = assignment.total_assigned || assignment.totalAssigned || 0;
const totalCompleted = assignment.total_completed || assignment.totalCompleted || 0;
const totalOverdue = assignment.total_overdue || assignment.totalOverdue || 0;
const completionRate = assignment.completion_rate || assignment.completionRate || 
                        (totalAssigned > 0 ? Math.round((totalCompleted / totalAssigned) * 100) : 0);
```

#### B. Updated Prompt Template to Include Performance Summary
Added "Performance Summary" section to all language prompts (English, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali):

```
Performance Summary:
- Total Tasks Assigned: ${totalAssigned}
- Tasks Completed: ${totalCompleted}
- Overdue Tasks: ${totalOverdue}
- Completion Rate: ${completionRate}%
```

#### C. Updated AI Instructions to Reference Statistics
Added explicit requirement in the prompt instructions:

**English:**
```
3. **MUST reference the performance statistics**: ${totalAssigned} tasks assigned, 
   ${totalCompleted} completed, ${totalOverdue} overdue, ${completionRate}% completion rate
```

**Critical Requirements:**
```
- **MUST mention the performance statistics** (${totalAssigned} assigned, 
  ${totalCompleted} completed, ${totalOverdue} overdue, ${completionRate}% rate) 
  within the warning text
```

Similar updates were made for Arabic and Urdu translations.

## How It Works Now

### Data Flow:
1. **Task Assignment Data** → Contains performance statistics from the database
2. **SendWarningModal** → Extracts and passes statistics to both:
   - The API endpoint for AI generation
   - The WarningTemplate component for display
3. **API Endpoint** → Includes statistics in the prompt to OpenAI
4. **OpenAI** → Generates warning text that references these statistics
5. **WarningTemplate** → Displays both:
   - The statistics in the "Performance Summary" section
   - The AI-generated warning text (which now also mentions these numbers)

### Before Fix:
```
Performance Summary:
- Total Tasks Assigned: 0
- Tasks Completed: 0
- Overdue Tasks: 0
- Completion Rate: 0%

Warning Details: [Generic warning without specific numbers]
```

### After Fix:
```
Performance Summary:
- Total Tasks Assigned: 15
- Tasks Completed: 8
- Overdue Tasks: 5
- Completion Rate: 53%

Warning Details: We are writing to address your task completion performance. 
You have been assigned 15 tasks, of which only 8 have been completed, 
with 5 tasks currently overdue. Your completion rate of 53% is below 
expectations and requires immediate improvement...
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Information**: All task statistics are now visible in both the summary and the warning text
2. **Consistent Data**: The same numbers appear in the structured summary and the narrative warning
3. **Better Context**: Managers and employees can see exact performance metrics
4. **Multilingual Support**: Works correctly in all supported languages (English, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali)
5. **Database Integration**: Properly stores all metrics in the `employee_warnings` table

## Testing Recommendations

1. Generate a warning for a task with known statistics
2. Verify the Performance Summary section shows correct numbers
3. Check that the AI-generated warning text also mentions these numbers
4. Test in different languages (especially Arabic and Urdu)
5. Verify the warning is properly saved to the database with all fields

## Related Tables

The fix ensures proper data flow to the `employee_warnings` table:
- `total_tasks_assigned`
- `total_tasks_completed`
- `total_tasks_overdue`
- `completion_rate`
- `task_id`
- `task_title`
- `task_description`
- `assignment_id`

## Notes

- The AI is now explicitly instructed to include the performance statistics in its generated warning
- The prompt uses bold text (**MUST**) to emphasize critical requirements
- All language variants have been updated with the same structure
- The system handles cases where statistics might be missing (defaults to 0)
