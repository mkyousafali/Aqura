### 3. Helper Script: `check-requests-tables.cjs`
**Location:** `scripts/check-requests-tables.cjs`

**Purpose:**
- Checks database table structures
- Identifies available columns and foreign keys
- Tests query strategies without FK relationships
- Useful for debugging and understanding data structure

## Technical Implementation

### Query Strategy
The implementation uses **denormalized data** already stored in the database tables. This approach:
- âœ… Avoids FK relationship errors
- âœ… Improves query performance
- âœ… Works with existing database schema
- âœ… No database migrations required

### Data Normalization
Raw data from the expense_requisitions table is normalized into a consistent structure:
```javascript
{
  request_type: 'requisition',
  request_id: requisition_number,
  request_date: created_at,
  creator_name: created_by,
  approver_name: approver_name,
  branch_name: branch_name,
  category_name_en: expense_category_name_en,
  category_name_ar: expense_category_name_ar,
  requester_name: requester_name,
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected',
  amount: amount,
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Statistics Dashboard
- Real-time counts updated from loaded data
- Clickable cards that filter the table

- **Search:** Full-text search across:

  - Category name
  - Requester name
  - Description

#### 3. Data Table
- Sortable columns (via browser default)
- Clickable rows to view details
- Responsive design
- Shows key information:
  - Requisition number
  - Branch
  - Creator
  - Approver
  - Category (English/Arabic)
  - Requester
  - Amount (formatted as SAR)
  - Status badge

#### 4. Detail Modal

## User Experience

### Navigation Flow

## Testing Performed

### âœ… Database Connection
- Verified table structures using check script
- Confirmed denormalized data availability
- Tested queries without FK relationships

### âœ… Data Loading
- Successfully loads requisitions
- Handles empty results gracefully

### âœ… Filtering & Search
- Status filter works correctly
- Search functionality works across all fields
- Stat cards filter data correctly

### âœ… UI/UX
- Modal opens and closes properly

## Accessibility (A11y)

âœ… **Zero accessibility errors** in RequestsManager component:

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading:** Queries all data once on mount
- **Client-side Filtering:** Fast filtering without additional API calls
- **Optimized Rendering:** Only renders visible rows
- **Memory Efficient:** Doesn't load unnecessary foreign key data

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
