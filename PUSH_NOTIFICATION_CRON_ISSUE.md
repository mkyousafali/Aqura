# Push Notification Queue Processing - pg_cron Not Available

## Problem
The automatic push notification processing requires `pg_cron` which is only available on Supabase Pro plan or higher.

## Current Status
- ✅ Notifications are automatically queued when created (trigger works)
- ✅ Edge Function can process queue when called manually
- ❌ No automatic scheduling (pg_cron not available on free tier)

## Solutions

### Option 1: Upgrade to Supabase Pro
Enable pg_cron and run the migration.

### Option 2: Manual Trigger (Current Workaround)
Manually trigger the Edge Function when needed:
```bash
node scripts/check-cron.js
```

### Option 3: Client-Side Polling (Recommended for Free Tier)
Add a polling mechanism in the frontend that calls the Edge Function periodically when users are active.

### Option 4: External Cron Service
Use a free external service like:
- Cron-job.org
- EasyCron
- GitHub Actions (scheduled workflows)

To call: `POST https://vmypotfsyrvuublyddyt.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-push-queue`
With header: `Authorization: Bearer [SERVICE_ROLE_KEY]`

## Recommendation
For production, use **Option 1** (Pro plan with pg_cron) or **Option 4** (External cron service).
