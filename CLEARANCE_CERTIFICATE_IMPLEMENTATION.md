  - `task_id`: Links to generated task
  - `assignment_id`: Links to task assignment
  - `role_type`: Type of role (branch_manager, inventory_manager, etc.)
  - `requires_erp_reference`: Boolean for ERP requirement
  - `requires_original_bill_upload`: Boolean for file upload requirement
  - `clearance_certificate_url`: URL to generated certificate

### 2. Task Generation Function

- Users can only view tasks assigned to them or from their branch
- Users can only update tasks assigned to them
- Proper validation of user authorization before task operations

## Usage Workflow

1. **Receiving Process**: Complete steps 1-3 in receiving process
2. **Save Data**: Save receiving data to database
3. **Generate Certificate**: Upload clearance certificate file
4. **Create Tasks**: System automatically creates role-specific tasks
5. **Notifications**: All assigned users receive notifications
6. **Task Completion**: Users complete tasks based on requirements
7. **Validation**: System validates completion requirements
8. **Tracking**: Progress tracked in dashboards and reports

This implementation provides a complete, automated workflow for managing the clearance certificate process with proper task assignment, notification, and completion tracking.
